# Cognitive Distortions
Project work by: Yisroel Len
## Problem Statement
As of 2019 [the number of psychological issues among teens is on the rise](https://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/issues/state-mental-health-america) and disturbing, to say the least. Especially considering the fact that the number of people who have insurance has risen with it. The purpose of this project is to help working therapists save time and increase effectiveness by identifying the cognitive distortions that are so common amongst people with depression, anxiety, anger management and many other basic disorders. The [categories of distortions](http://www.pacwrc.pitt.edu/curriculum/313_MngngImpctTrmtcStrssChldWlfrPrfssnl/hndts/HO15_ThnkngAbtThnkng.pdf) that I used was the one described by Dr. David Burns in his book, ["Feeling Good, the new mood therapy"](https://feelinggood.com/). This is a well known and well researched categorization of the possible errors in thinking, that is relied upon by psychologists in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I will attempt to collect as many possible examples of irrational thoughts and build a model that can identify and find those "thoughts". The identification of those "thoughts" would ideally be used in a recorded therapy session, as a method for helping therapists discern areas for future analysis. It would then highlight and return the relevant sections to the therapist and client for further investigation.
